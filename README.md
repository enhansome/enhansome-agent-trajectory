> **Trajectories are the source code of the agentic era.**

*An **Agent Trajectory** is the step-by-step record of an autonomous agent's execution. It captures the agent's internal reasoning (thoughts, planning, reflections), the actions it took (tool calls, API payloads, bash commands), and the environment’s responses (observations, errors, system state changes). Trajectories are becoming the first-hand asset for debugging, evaluating, training, and auditing AI agents.*

This repository is a curated collection of papers, tools, and benchmarks on **analyzing, diagnosing, and learning from LLM agent trajectories**.

This list tracks work across the trajectory-analysis pipeline:

* **Characterizing** how agents behave and where they tend to fail
* **Localizing and attributing** failures to a specific agent, step, or root cause
* **Intervening and recovering** from failures at runtime
* **Learning and optimizing** future behavior from past trajectories
* **Detecting anomalies** and forecasting failure before it happens
* **Assessing the quality** of individual steps or whole trajectories
* **Representing** trajectories as structured, traceable objects
* **Supporting humans** in inspecting, visualizing, and explaining agent behavior
* **Benchmarking** all of the above with labeled datasets

Contributions, discussions, and collaborations are welcome! | see [Contributing](#contributing).
